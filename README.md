# RegionalEverstone
[This mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/regional-everstone) is for use with Pixelmon Reforged.

Regional Everstone allows you to pass down a parent pokemon's regional form (Alolan/Galarian) to its offspring by holding an everstone.  
If both parents are holding an Everstone, the form passed down will be 50% from each parent.  
This does not affect natures, so everstones will still pass down natures as expected.

This mod is only required on the server, client is optional.
